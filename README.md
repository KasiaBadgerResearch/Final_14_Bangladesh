# How has income inequality evolved in Bangladesh between 1985 and 2010, as measured by the income shares held by the highest 10% versus the lowest 10% of the population?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), this study examines the evolution of income inequality in Bangladesh between 1985 and 2010, focusing on the income shares of the highest and lowest 10% of the population. Over this period, the wealthiest decile’s share of total income increased modestly, while the poorest decile’s share declined slightly, revealing a persistent and widening gap. These trends demonstrate that aggregate economic growth did not translate into equitable gains for all citizens, highlighting the structural challenges of inclusive development. By juxtaposing the trajectories of the richest and poorest segments, this analysis emphasizes the multidimensional nature of development and the critical need for targeted policies to reduce inequality. The findings underscore that achieving meaningful progress requires addressing both macroeconomic growth and the distributional consequences of that growth.

## 1. Question

How has income inequality evolved in Bangladesh between 1985 and 2010, as measured by the income shares held by the highest 10% versus the lowest 10% of the population?

- **Top decile income proxy**: Income share held by the highest 10% of the population (%)
- **Bottom decile income proxy**: Income share held by the lowest 10% of the population (%)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Income share held by the highest 10% of the population (%)
  - Income share held by the lowest 10% of the population (%)
- **Coverage**: Bahrain, 1960–2010
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Bangladesh.
2. **Selected relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted top and bottom decile income indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a line graph comparing income shares of the highest vs lowest 10% over time.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Income share of the highest 10% (%)**: Increased slightly over the period, indicating growing concentration of wealth.
- **Income share of the lowest 10% (%)**: Decreased modestly, showing declining relative share for the poorest segment.
- **Comparison**: While both trends were gradual, the widening gap highlights persistent inequality in income distribution.

(Table 1. Pivoted dataset)

## 5. Interpretation

- Bangladesh experienced moderate shifts in income concentration, with the richest 10% capturing slightly more of total income while the poorest 10% received less.
- These patterns suggest that economic growth during this period did not equally benefit all population segments.
- Policies aimed at poverty reduction and redistribution remain crucial to address structural income inequality.

## 6. Limitations

- Only two indicators analyzed; other dimensions of inequality (e.g., Gini coefficient, regional disparities, gender differences) are not captured.
- National-level data may mask subpopulation or urban/rural variations.
- Descriptive analysis only; causal mechanisms driving changes in income shares were not tested.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Examine income shares across additional deciles or quintiles to map broader distribution patterns.
- Analyze regional and urban/rural differences in income inequality.
- Compare Bangladesh’s trends with other South Asian countries to contextualize the evolution of inequality.
- Investigate policy interventions, social programs, or economic shocks that influenced the relative shares of top and bottom income groups.
